Passionate solution seeker who is looking to be a valuable part of a growth-oriented team. I chose coding because of my curiosity about how things work and my enthusiasm for creating things through code. When I am not coding I enjoy taking walks by the beach, rollerblading and swimming. In my spare time at home I practice meditation and educate myself on overall well-being. As an extrovert I cherish time recharging batteries at my work desk, finding it necessary to maintain my productivity and energy.
